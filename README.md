# Sponsorship

All the repositories in the [c-frame organization](https://github.com/c-frame), [networked-aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) and [aframe](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) repositories have in the issues tracker the purple "sponsors needed", "$100", "$50", "$30", "$20", "$10" labels and blue "sponsors goal achieved".

Issues having the "sponsors needed" label are waiting a one-time sponsorship from one or several individuals to the issue's assignee to work on it.

[Board listing the issues that need sponsors](https://github.com/orgs/c-frame/projects/2/views/1)

You can also consider donating a small amount monthly to the listed developers (see the assignees on the issues) if you're interested in using any planned features in your project.

When the developper received enough sponsorship to work on an issue, the blue label "sponsors goal achieved" is added.

People having a sponsors page:

- [Vincent Fretin](https://github.com/sponsors/vincentfretin): Working mainly on networked-aframe and aframe-inspector/aframe-editor
- [Diego Marcos](https://github.com/sponsors/dmarcos): Be aware that A-Frame is 100% independent and the current donations doesn't even cover the infrastructure cost (domain registration, build bots, ...)

Note for the developpers creating the issues with the label "sponsors needed":
- This repository tracker is used to link to issues outside the c-frame organization that also need sponsors so the issues are visible in the board linked above.
- The issues having the "sponsors needed" label in this repository are automatically added to the board, but issues from other repositories in c-frame organization need to be added manually (using more than one "Auto-add to project" workflow is a paid GitHub feature)
