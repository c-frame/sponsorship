# Sponsorship

All the repositories in the [c-frame organization](https://github.com/c-frame), [networked-aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) and [aframe](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) repositories have in the issues tracker the purple "sponsors needed", "$500", "$100", "$50", "$30", "$20", "$10" labels and blue "sponsorship goal achieved".

Issues having the "sponsors needed" label are waiting a one-time sponsorship from one or several individuals to the issue's assignee to work on it.

Be sure to communicate to the developer that your sponsorship is related to a specific issue, publicly by leaving a comment on the issue "I contributed $xx to @developer towards the sponsorship goal." or  "I sponsored $xx to @developer to work on it." for example or privately to the developer on Discord or Slack if you know that they are active there.

If the donater doesn't add a comment themself, the developer will add a comment on the issue if there was any sponsorship received, respecting privacy if the donation was private, comment examples: "A private sponsor contributed $xx to the sponsorship goal. Thank you!", "This work was sponsored by a private sponsor. Thank you!", "Thanks @somebody for the sponsorship!", or "@somebody contributed $xx towards the sponsorship goal".

When the developper received enough sponsorship to work on an issue, the blue label "sponsorship goal achieved" is added.

[Board listing the issues that need sponsors](https://github.com/orgs/c-frame/projects/2/views/1)

If there is an issue you want to sponsor that is not listed there, please reach out to the most suitable developer for the task.

You can also consider donating a small amount monthly to the listed developers, just supporting their work and the countless time they spend helping you with your questions.
Some issues on the board don't have a price label, that just means the developer will eventually work on it if there is enough monthly sponsors.

People having a sponsors page:

- [Vincent Fretin](https://github.com/sponsors/vincentfretin): Working mainly on [networked-aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe), aframe-inspector/[aframe-editor](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-editor) and other components in the c-frame organization.
- [Diego Marcos](https://github.com/sponsors/dmarcos): Be aware that A-Frame is 100% independent and the current donations doesn't even cover the infrastructure cost (domain registration, build bots, ...)

Note for the developers creating the issues with the label "sponsors needed":
- This repository tracker is used to link to issues outside the c-frame organization that need sponsors so the issues are visible automatically in the board linked above. Please use as the issue title "[repo name] the original issue title". You can also create an issue here to create a new A-Frame component.
- Issues from other repositories in c-frame organization need to be added manually on the board. Using more than one "Auto-add to project" workflow is a paid GitHub feature and we're not currently paying for that.
- After you added the "sponsors needed" and price labels and assigned yourself to the issue, add a comment to the issue: "You can sponsor $xx to link_to_developer_sponsors_page to expedite this fix. Find other work you can sponsor at https://github.com/c-frame/sponsorship" for a bug fix or "You can sponsor $xx to link_to_developer_sponsors_page fully or partially to work on this feature. Find other work you can sponsor at https://github.com/c-frame/sponsorship" for a feature.
- On your sponsors page, add a link to https://github.com/c-frame/sponsorship
